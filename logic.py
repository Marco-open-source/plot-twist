"""The rules of Plot Twist. Pure functions on a state dict: no screen code, no database code.

State: {"scene": str, "inventory": list of str, "drawer_emptied": bool, "table_emptied": bool, "ending": None or "A" or "B"}
Every function returns (new_state, message) and never changes the state it was given.
A rejected action returns a copy that is equal to the old state.
Once an ending is reached, every action is rejected.
